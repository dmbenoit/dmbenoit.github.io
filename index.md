### Exploring patterns and drivers of spatial overlap in freshwater fishes using a multivariate regression tree
The spatial distribution of fishes is strongly dependent on the temperature of their environments. In temperate lakes, fishes with different thermal optima can become spatially segregated. Although spatial segregation has been studied in indiviudal lakes, broad-scale patterns are not yet understood. In this project, I explored patterns and drivers of fish spatial overlap  in 438 lakes across Ontario, Canada.

Using a multivariate regression tree, I identified five clusters of lakes exhibiting different patterns of spatial overlap and found that temperature and lake depth are strong drivers of these patterns. These findings provide a better understanding of broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and allow us to predict how spatial overlap, and ultimately species interactions and competition, may change under a warming climate.

### Size spectrum model reveals importance of considering species interactions in a freshwater fisheries management context
Inland fisheries have a significant cultural and economic value around the globe, providing dietary protein, income, and recreation. Consequently, methods for monitoring and managing these important fisheries are continually being refined. In this study, I developed a multispecies size spectrum model for the fish community
of Lake Nipissing, a large, productive lake in Ontario, Canada.

Using this model, I explored the impacts of potential fishing regimes and management scenarios on fish community dynamics while taking species interactions into account. I found that community dynamics following changes in fishing mortality were driven by complex interactions among species, including competition and predation.

### Creating sortable guilds for fishes of the Great Lakes using dimension reduction techniques and cluster analysis
Selective fish sorting, wherein desirable species are passed at barriers and undesirable species are blocked, has been proposed as a method to solve dam-induced habitat fragmentation in rivers. Sorting systems that separate fish based on shared attributes among groups of species (i.e., guilds) are anticipated to be a more efficient solution than separating every individual species. 

In this study, I explored the guild structure of fishes of the Great Lakes Basin as well as potential invaders (220 species) using 21 traits associated with phenology, morphology, physiology, and behaviour. Using multivariate ordinations and cluster analysis, I identified five guilds dictated by major gradients in migratory status, spawning temperature, maximum total length, relative eye size, trophic level, and the ability to perceive sound and electrical fields.

### Identifying influential parameters of a multi-species model through sensitivity analyses
Ecosystem-based approaches that take species interactions into account have shifted to the forefront of fisheries modelling and management in recent years. As a
result, multispecies size spectrum models have been increasingly used to explore impacts of fishing on marine community dynamics.

In this study, I conducted a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis pairing the Morris and Sobol methods to identify
life-history parameters having the largest influence on model outputs.
