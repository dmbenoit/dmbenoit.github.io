### Exploring patterns and drivers of spatial overlap in freshwater fishes using a multivariate regression tree
The spatial distribution of fishes is strongly dependent on the temperature of their environments. In temperate lakes, fishes with different thermal optima can become spatially segregated. Although spatial segregation has been studied in indiviudal lakes, broad-scale patterns are not yet understood. In this project, I explored patterns and drivers of fish spatial overlap  in 438 lakes across Ontario, Canada.

Using a multivariate regression tree, I identified five clusters of lakes exhibiting different patterns of spatial overlap and found that temperature and lake depth are strong drivers of these patterns. These findings provide a better understanding of broad-scale patterns of spatial overlap and allow us to predict how spatial overlap, and ultimately species interactions and competition, may change under a warming climate.

### Size spectrum model reveals importance of considering species interactions in a freshwater fisheries management context
Inland fisheries have a significant cultural and economic value around the globe, providing dietary protein, income, and recreation. Consequently, methods for monitoring and managing these important fisheries are continually being refined. In this study, I developed a multispecies size spectrum model for the fish community
of Lake Nipissing, a large, productive lake in Ontario, Canada.

Using this model, I explored the impacts of potential fishing regimes and management scenarios on fish community dynamics while taking species interactions into account. I found that community dynamics following changes in fishing mortality were driven by complex interactions among species, including competition and predation.
